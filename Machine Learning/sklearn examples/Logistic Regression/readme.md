A brief introduction to Logistic Regression:

- Logistic regression is a statistical approach for producing results in **binary format** which is used to predict the outcome of a categorial dependent variable. So the outcome should be **discrete/categorical** such as:
**"0 or 1"**,
**"Yes or No"**,
**"True or False"** and
**"High or Low"**

- Logistic regression describes and estimates the relationship between one dependent binary variable and independent variables.

- The sigmoid function, also called logistic function gives an ‘S’ shaped curve that can take any real-valued number and map it into a value between 0 and 1.
